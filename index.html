    <h1>Whatever You Want</h1>
    <h2>By Whoever You Believe</h2>
    <h3><i>An Imaginary Website for Imaginary People about Imaginary Things</i></h3>
    <h4>...If you look closely at the center of this webpage, there is an image...</h4>
      <p>Do you see it?</p>
    <h4>...What do you see..?</h4>
      <p><em>Is</em> it a salmon colored unicorn bucking up on it's hind legs? <strong>Or</strong> is it a fox, smiling cunningly back at you? <em><strong>Maybe</em></strong> it's not an animal, and instead a room with but a single painting of the Mona Lisa on the wall. Perhaps it's your worst of your fears... </p>
    <h4>...You disagree...</h4>
      <p>You don't see any of that. <u>No, that would be ridiculous.</u> <strong>Your eyes are closed.</strong></p>
    <h4>...Before You can See the Unseen, You MUST...</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Open your Left eye.</li>
        <li>Open your Right eye.</li>
        <li>Take a very deep breath.</li>
        <li>Hold it.</li>
        <li>Hold it...</li>
        <li>Release.</li>
      </ol>
    <h4>...Now you are ready to see...</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>See it.</li>
        <li>Feel it.</li>
        <li>Hear it.</li>
        <li>Smell it.</li>
        <li>Most importantly taste it. Taste the salmon colored unicorn.</li>
      </ul>
